# accenture-ai-hackathon

the current plan is taking the [neat ai already made](http://talk.cregox.com/t/thanks-to-mari-o-time-to-focus-on-ai/7653) for [mariox](http://basiux.org#mariox) and applying it for [hutter](http://prize.hutter1.net/).

pretty much like we [started doing to it for the 2017 google hash-code](https://github.com/basiux/googlehashcode2017).
